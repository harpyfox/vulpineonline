            <h1>colophon</h1>
            <p>this website is my personal hate letter to the modern web.</p>
            <p>i do not want a website that moves. i do not want fades. i do not want pulldowns. i do not want scrolling
                animations. you would think as an animator i would enjoy these things, but the line between form and function
                has long been crossed. i enable 'reduced motion' on my devices if the option is enabled. that's 
                how bad it is.</p>
            <p>i just want a webpage that shows me what i want to see. that is my goal for this website: a portfolio that
                quickly and reliably shows you the shit you came here for.</p>
            <h2>technologies</h2>
            <p>the site is hosted with Cloudflare Workers. the documentation for their static site solution is a bit lacking and 
                you can tell it's kind of a shoe-in to try and deprecate Cloudflare Pages. but it works well enough, and it's 
                free. for now, at least.</p>
            <p>javascript is minimal. the site functions without it.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/harpyfox/vulpineonline">github</a> is used for version control. it deploys automatically when a push is made to the repository.
                    isn't that nice.</p>
