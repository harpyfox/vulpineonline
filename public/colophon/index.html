                <p>this website is my personal hate letter to the modern web.</p>
                <p>i do not want a website that moves. i do not want fades. i do not want pulldowns. i do not want scrolling
                    animations. you would think as an animator i would enjoy these things, but the line between form and function
                    has long been crossed.</p>
                <p>i just want a webpage that shows me what i want to see. that is my goal for this website: a portfolio that
                    quickly and reliably shows you the shit you came here for.</p>
